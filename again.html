There is enough treachery, hatred, violence,
Absurdity in the average human being
To supply any given army on any given day.
AND The Best At Murder Are Those
Who Preach Against It.
And The Best At Hate Are Those
Who Preach LOVE
AND THE BEST AT WAR
--FINALLY--ARE THOSE WHO PREACH
PEACE

Those Who Preach GOD
NEED God
Those Who Preach PEACE
Do Not Have Peace.
THOSE WHO PREACH LOVE
DO NOT HAVE LOVE
BEWARE THE PREACHERS
Beware The Knowers.

Beware
Those Who
Are ALWAYS
READING
BOOKS

Beware Those Who Either Detest
Poverty Or Are Proud Of It

BEWARE Those Quick To Praise
For They Need PRAISE In Return

BEWARE Those Who Are Quick To Censure:
They Are Afraid Of What They Do
Not Know

Beware Those Who Seek Constant
Crowds; They Are Nothing
Alone

Beware
The Average Man
The Average Woman
BEWARE Their Love

Their Love Is Average, Seeks
Average
But There Is Genius In Their Hatred
There Is Enough Genius In Their
Hatred To Kill You, To Kill
Anybody.

Not Wanting Solitude                           Not Being Able To Love Fully
Not Understanding Solitude                     They Will BELIEVE Your Love
They Will Attempt To Destroy                   Incomplete
Anything                                       AND THEN THEY WILL HATE

From Their Own
                                              And Their Hatred Will Be Perfect
Not Being Able                                Like A Shining Diamond
To Create Art                                 Like A Knife
They Will Not                                 Like A Mountain

They Will Consider Their Failure    
As Creators                                   Their Finest
Only As A Failure                             Art
